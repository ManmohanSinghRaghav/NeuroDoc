# Hierarchical neural topic modeling for enterprise document

## Introduction
Hierarchical neural topic modeling is a technique for extracting and organizing topics from enterprise documents. It leverages neural networks to identify hierarchical relationships between topics, enabling better document classification and understanding.

## Features
- Automatic topic extraction from enterprise documents.
- Hierarchical organization of topics.
- Scalable and efficient for large document collections.
- Customizable for domain-specific applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NeuroDoc.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NeuroDoc
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your document dataset in the required format.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```
3. Generate topics:
   ```bash
   python generate_topics.py --model_path /path/to/model
   ```
